ToDo
==============================
- Automatically install via install.sh (including necessary library and webserver)
- Enable labels for the sockets, so that it is easier so operate them via url (i.e. http://rbp/index.php?label=Desklamp&state=on)
- Enable configuration by webinterface instead of config.php
- Logging (When was What switched on by Who)
- Multi Language Support
- Authentication via Username/Cookie
- Use Cookies so that the user doesn't have to enter the credentials each time
- Optimize Webtraffic so that preferably few web request got send over cellular

Done
==============================
- Configuration in one file (config.php)
- Option to send commands repeatedly
- Option to group socket in groups
- Customization of the App to work good at a iDevice (Custom Home Screen Icon/No Resizing/No Navbar)
- Integrate send binary from rcswitch-pi in the repository 
- Use github as repository
- Option to switch a whole group of sockets on/off
